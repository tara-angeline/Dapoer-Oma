**Overview**

“Dapoer Oma, meaning "Grandma's Kitchen" in Indonesian, is a heartfelt recipe and blog website 
dedicated to Indonesian cuisine. As an international student from Indonesia, moving miles away 
from my home felt daunting. However, one of the things that helped me through studying abroad 
are recipes from back home, some of which are heirlooms from both my grandmother and mother.  
To unwind from the stressful college life, I try to recreate some of these recipes in my free time. 
This website will feature a curated list of Indonesian cuisine recipes and a blog space, where I share my 
experiences living abroad.

**Targeted Audience**

Firstly, I aim to connect with fellow cooking enthusiasts who share a love for exploring new recipes. 
For Indonesians living abroad, I hope to offer a taste of home, providing a culinary remedy for 
homesickness through cherished dishes and shared experiences. 

Secondly, I want to invite those unfamiliar with Indonesian cuisine to explore our rich and wonderful 
cuisine. With easy-to-follow recipes and personal anecdotes, I hope “Dapoer Oma” can offer a 
gateway to discovering the diverse and delicious world of Indonesian cooking, right from the 
comfort of your own kitchen.
